To start, open a server.
To run the server, enter "./server.py" along with any flags and arguments you want to give to the server.
Then connect clients and other servers as you see fit.
To run the client, enter "./client.py" along with any flags and arguments you want to give to the client.

IMPORTANT:
Please keep the directory logs/ in the same directory that contains server.py and client.py, so the scripts can write all of their logs to there.  This can easily be changed by me but I wrote it this way to stay organized.  If this ruins the grading algorithm I can change it and resubmit it in five minutes or so.
