Question 4 - With the way of computing forwarding tables that you implemented, is it possible for a malicious host to intercept packets from someone else? If it is possible, without changing the spanning tree calculation, what could you do to prevent that? If it is not possible, what prevents it?
Yes it is possible.  If a node were to connect to the network somehow, it would start receiving the “flooded” messages from its neighbor.  It would be able to read the flooded messages.  To prevent this, we can place restrictions on the machines that are allowed to join our network.
