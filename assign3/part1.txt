Question 1 - What are the final statistics for the ping command on the loopless
topology?
--- 10.0.0.4 ping statistics ---
10 packets transmitted, 10 received, 0% packet loss, time 9015ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 6.988/9.784/20.283/4.594 ms

Question 2 - What are the same statistics on the topology with loops?
--- 10.0.0.4 ping statistics ---
10 packets transmitted, 5 received, +23 duplicates, 50% packet loss, time 9018ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1249.801/7503.005/14639.488/3684.966 ms, pipe 7

Question 3 - In 1-2 sentences, what causes any differences in the ping results on the
loopless vs loop-y topology?
Because each node floods the network with any packet it receives with the dumb controller, the self-loops cause duplicate ACKs to reach the source host.  The self-loops also cause some packets to get stuck in an infinite loop until their TTL expires and they never reach the source.
